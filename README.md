# MAVREC: Multiview Aerial Visual Recognition

## Overview
MAVREC (Multiview Aerial Visual Recognition) is a comprehensive dataset that aims to enhance aerial visual perception through multi-view data integration, featuring synchronized scenes from ground and drone-mounted cameras. This paper got accepted at CVPR 2024  and is designed to improve object detection models by providing a diverse set of aerial and ground-view images captured in various European landscapes.

## Dataset
The MAVREC dataset includes approximately 2.5 hours of high-quality 2.7K video, over 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes, making it a substantial resource for advancing aerial object detection technologies.

### Download
The dataset can be accessed and downloaded from the official MAVREC website:
