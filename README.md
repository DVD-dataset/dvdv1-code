# MAVREC: Multiview Aerial Visual Recognition

## Overview
MAVREC (Multiview Aerial Visual Recognition) is a comprehensive dataset that aims to enhance aerial visual perception through multi-view data integration, featuring synchronized scenes from ground and drone-mounted cameras and is designed to improve object detection models by providing a diverse set of aerial and ground-view images captured in various European landscapes.

**MAVREC got accepted in CVPR 2024 ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥**
